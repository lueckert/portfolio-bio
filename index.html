<h3>Technical Communication</h3>
<section class="grid_7">
<p>I get asked all the time what I&#39;m going to do with...what was it? &quot;Technical Communication.&quot; I think the answer to that question is not &#39;what am I going to do with this major,&#39; but what technical communication is going to do for me. The field is so broad that I could do anything from writing and designing instruction manuals for strollers to editing grant proposals. It&#39;s a little like graphic design in that it gives me the problem-solving and communication skills I need for the professional world. However, unlike graphic design, I solve problems through a combination of language and design to communicate a specific idea. I have to carefully choose the right words and design a logical order of information as well as graphics so that people will learn exactly how to do something. The short version is that I will have the writing, editing and design skills to be able to develop a wide variety of publications and technical documents. That&#39;s what technical communication will do for me. </p> </section>

<h3>Background Information</h3>

<p>I grew up in Walla Walla, WA from the age of 11 as a homeschooler who eventually went to public middle and high school for music, physical education, and science, the three things that are really hard to do by yourself at home. My sophomore year of high school I took film photography (two years after they switched to only digital) which sparked an interest in all things photography to this day. After all this time I still love photography and am still learning new things about it. When I started attending Eastern I didn&#39;t know what graphic design was until I started taking classes for the VCD minor that goes with the tech comm degree. I know I loved it, but I realize now that it&#39;s because as a photographer, I&#39;m trying to solve the same kind of problem as graphic artists. I want my photos to be beautiful, but I also want them to serve a purpose (although I do enjoy artistic photography).</p>    </section>

<h3>Professional Objectives</h3>

<p>After I graduate I would like to work for the Spokesman-Review or the Inlander as a copy editor, page designer, or photographer. I don&#39;t have a lot of plans beyond that, but I would like to have my own photography business someday.</p></section>
